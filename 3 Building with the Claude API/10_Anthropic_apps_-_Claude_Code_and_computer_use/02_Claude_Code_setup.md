## What Claude Code Can Do

Claude Code comes with a comprehensive set of tools to help with your development workflow:

- **File operations** - Search, read, and edit files in your project
- **Terminal access** - Run commands directly from the conversation
- **Web access** - Search documentation, fetch code examples, and more
- **MCP Server support** - Add additional tools by connecting MCP servers

The MCP integration is particularly powerful because it means you can extend Claude Code's capabilities by adding specialized tools for databases, APIs, or any other services you work with.

Claude Code works across MacOS, Windows WSL, and Linux, so you can use it regardless of your development environment.
